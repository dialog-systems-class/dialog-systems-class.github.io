Students at UPenn were interested in the Amazon Alexa Challenge, so we decided to put together a special topics relating to dialogue systems and deep learning.  João Sedoc is leading the effort, with help from Chris Callison-Burch and Lyle Ungar.

Here is a description of what João has in mind for the course: 

I was thinking that there are a few parts to this, 
- deep learning book (http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)  for a foundation and recent papers for dialog systems
- learning tensorflow and how to train (particularly also get the data and manipulate it) and create a chatbot
- learning how to interface with Alexa SDK


Readings:
week 1
 - DL book chapter 5 (general ML methods) 
 - DL book chapter 6 ( feed-forward NN)

 - tensorflow sections https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials basic linear models

week 2:
 - DL book chapter 7,8
 - DL book chapter 10
 - Tuney "From Frequency to Meaning: Vector Space Models of Semantics"

- tensorflow sections https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials language models

week 3:
 - Sutskever et al "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks"
 - Bahdanau et al "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate"

week 4 - 13:
 We will follow the papers on https://github.com/andrewt3000/DL4NLP#conversation-modeling--dialog
